### Task 
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z. 

* Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
* Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
* Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

| X | Y | Z |        |
|---|---|---|--------|
| R | R | B | Case 1 |
| R | B | R | Case 2 |
| B | R | R | Case 3 |

##### Case 1:
\[\frac{4}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{{10}}{{63}}\]
