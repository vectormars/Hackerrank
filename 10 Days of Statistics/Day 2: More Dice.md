### Task 
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 9.

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  | 8  | 9  |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8  | 9  | 10 |
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  | 10 | 11 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |

Total = 36 
sum6 = 5 with one 3 and 3    
sum6_different = 4     
Pr(sum = 6 and different) = 4/36 =1/9
