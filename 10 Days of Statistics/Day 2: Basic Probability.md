### Task 1
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  | 8  | 9  |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8  | 9  | 10 |
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  | 10 | 11 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |

Total = 36     
Greater than 9 = 6     
Pr(at most 9)=30/36 = 5/6

### Task 2
For a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and their sum is 6.

Condition for sum = 6       
(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)      
Pr= 4/36 =1/9

### Task 3
There are 3 urns: X, Y and Z.

* Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
* Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
* Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each urn. What is the probability that the 3 balls drawn consist of 2 red balls and 1 black ball?

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
|Urn 1 | R | R | B |
|Urn 2 | R | B | R |
|Urn 3 | B | R | R |

Case 1: (4/7)(5/9)(4/8)=80/504      
Case 2: (4/7)(4/9)(4/8)=64/504   
Case 3: (3/7)(5/9)(4/8)=60/504    

Pr= 204/504 = 17/42

### Task 4
Bag 1 contains 4 red balls and 5 black balls.        
Bag 2 contains 3 red balls and 7 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from the Bag 1, and 2 balls are drawn from Bag 2. Find the probability that 2 balls are black and 1 ball is red.
|   |bag 1 |bag 2|

|Urn 1 | R | R | B |
|Urn 2 | R | B | R |
|Urn 3 | B | R | R |
