### Task 
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most .

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  | 8  | 9  |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8  | 9  | 10 |
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  | 10 | 11 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |

Total = 36     
Greater than 9 = 6     
Pr(at most 9)=30/36 = 5/6
