    "Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike, he took exactly n steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill or a downhill step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level. We define the following terms:\n",
    "* A mountain is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.\n",
    "* A valley is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through."
